# MarketingEmailCampaign
The marketing team of an e-commerce site has launched an email campaign. This site has email addresses from all the users who created an account in the past.
They have chosen a random sample of users and emailed them. The email let the user know about a new feature implemented on the site. From the marketing team perspective, a success is if the user clicks on the link inside of the email. This link takes the user to the company site.
